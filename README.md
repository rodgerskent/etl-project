## Extract, Transform & Load to SQL Project 
Built an advanced practice nurse (APN) credentialling management process using Python, SQL, SQL Alchemy, PG Admin and the Professional & Occupational License dataset published daily by the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA). Key analyst actions included:
* []()Extract a 1.2 million row professional license file published by DORA daily
* []()Built a fictitious employee roster representative of an anesthesia practice or health system employing anesthesia clinicians.
* []()Transformed the data so that it only included registered nurses and advanced practice nurses. And, so that it could be loaded into a relational or non-relational database. The transformation to include cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating and other actions. 
* []()Designed the database using an entity relationship diagram (ERD) methodology
* []()Placed the final tables into a project database
* []()Built an exception management reporting process making it easy to identify non-compliant clinician license issue for action

## Key Insights
The following key insights were brought to life in the assessment.
* []()There are 1252 active non-physician anesthesia clinicians and 196,991 registered nurses licensed in Colorado 
* []()DORA does not track “compact” (out-of-state)licenses in their Professional & Occupational License dataset which result in non-compliant advanced practitioners to show as compliant when they are deficient. Employers must directly ensure compact license compliance.  
* []()An API centric application to provide regular updates to healthcare credentialling professionals is not costly to create or maintain.
